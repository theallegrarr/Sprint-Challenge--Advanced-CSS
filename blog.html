                Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.
                Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.
